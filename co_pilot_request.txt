Hi — can you paste a clarified, copy‑ready set of changes I should apply to the repo? Please include only plain text (no secrets). I need:

1. Exact file paths and full file contents to add or replace (e.g., `app/scripts/train_predictor.py`, `app/pages/1_Map.py`, `.github/workflows/locum-agent.yml`).
2. Required env vars and example values (placeholders only), plus which email route to enable: SMTP or Power Automate.
3. Exact CSV schemas and 1–3 sample rows for:
   - `app/data/processed/facility_features.csv`
   - `app/data/processed/contacts.csv`
4. Any column-name mappings if your expected names differ from the repo.
5. A 2-line “how to run” snippet to verify locally (commands to run).

No secrets, please — I’ll add those to GitHub/Streamlit secrets later. Thanks!
